# Updating a Player's CSS

- Go into the KMC, and enter the Studio section.
- Select the player to edit
- Click the plugins section on the left navigation
- Click UI Variables add a UI variable named `IframeCustomPluginCss1` which points to the hosted CSS file

You're probably going to have to update the CSS files to make sure they're pointing to the correct images after hosting them.
